# Docker ELK stack

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/deviantony/docker-elk](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/deviantony/docker-elk?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Run the latest version of the ELK (Elasticseach, Logstash, Kibana) stack with Docker and Docker-compose.

It will give you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticseach and the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the official images:

* [elasticsearch](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/)
* [logstash](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/logstash/)
* [kibana](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/kibana/)

# Requirements

## Setup

1. Install [Docker](http://docker.io).
2. Install [Docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. Clone this repository

##Increase max_map_count on your host (Linux)

You need to increase max_map_count on your Docker host:

````bash
$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
````


## SELinux

On distributions which have SELinux enabled out-of-the-box you will need to either re-context the files or set SELinux into Permissive mode in order for docker-elk to start properly.
For example on Redhat and CentOS, the following will apply the proper context:

````bash
.-root@centos ~
-$ chcon -R system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 docker-elk/
````

# Usage

You can also choose to run it in background (detached mode):

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

And then access Kibana UI by hitting [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.

*NOTE*: You'll need to inject data into logstash before being able to create a logstash index in Kibana. Then all you should have to do is to
hit the create button.

See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/setup.html#connect

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:
* 5000: Logstash TCP input.
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

## Ship Container Logs

Example:-

syslog driver: –log-driver=syslog

```bash
$ docker run --log-driver=syslog  --log-opt syslog-address=[tcp|udp]://host:port --tag optional-container-name 
```
 
```bash 
$ docker run -it -d --log-driver=syslog  --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://host_ip:5000 -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
```
